date d;
date* p=&d;
date& r=d

(*p).day(); dereferenced pointer equal to p->day(); or r.day();

nullpointer is the 0 of the memory
can't apper at nullpointer
nullpointer can point to nullpointer(nobody), reference can't

p->operator=(b);  //operator equal overloaded in class declaration maybe
(*p)=b; 	  //using dereferenced pointer

std::move semantic allow to swap without hard copying 

b = std::move(a) a now is unknown
